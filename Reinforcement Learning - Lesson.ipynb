There is, however, a third breed of learning: reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning seeks to train a model make a sequence of decisions.\n",

    "## What is reinforcement learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement is training a model to achieve a certain goal through the process of trial and error. In RL, there are 5 main components: the <b>environment</b>, the <b>agent</b>, <b>actions</b>, <b>rewards</b>, and <b>states</b>. Those five components interact in the way shown in the diagram below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"rl_chart.png\">\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The agent is simply the model or artifical intelligence being trained. The environment is the interactive world in which the agent acts. The states are different, distinct versions of the environment. Actions are performed by the agent on the environment. The rewards are positive or negative feedback values corresponding to the actions taken and the effect they have on the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<img src = \"penguin_game.png\">\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This image represents a possible environment. In this environment, the penguin in the bottom left corner would be the <b>agent</b>. It ultimately wants to end up at the fish in the upper right corner. However, there are obstacles in its way there - the shark and the mines. The penguin must make a series of <b>actions</b> that will allow it to reach the fish while avoiding the obstacles. The <b>rewards</b> in this case could be as follows:<br> <br>\n",
    "<center>+1 if the penguin moves to an empty ocean space<br>\n",
    "-1 if the penguin runs into the \"wall\" of the environment<br>\n",
    "-50 if the penguin moves to the shark space<br>\n",
    "-100 if the penguin moves to a mine space<br>\n",
    "+100 if the penguin moves to the fish space</center>\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "So as the penguin chooses an <b>action</b> each turn, it is then presented with a new <b>state</b> and given a <b>reward</b> depending on what type of space it moved onto. With this new information, the penguin or <b>agent</b> will then evaluate the new <b>state</b> and select the next<b>action</b>.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Over time, through enough trial and error (and the penguin hopefully narrowly escaping death by shark or mine), the penguin would ultimately learn the best route to the highest <b>reward</b> - navigating to the fish while avoiding the mines and the shark."
